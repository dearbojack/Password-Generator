## Solution

1. Ask for user input of preferred password length (10-64), and validate user input;
2. Ask for user input of preferred character types (1-4), and validate user input;
3. Generate password based on user input:
   1. if user prefered password length > available characters, ask for user input again;
   2. if user prefered password length <= available characters,
      1. create an array of user selected number of character types;
      2. merge the array elements into an array of all available characters;
      3. get user selected number of random elements from the array;
      4. use `array.join()` to concat the array elements into password format
4. write password value
5. update html
